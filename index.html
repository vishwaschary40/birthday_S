      From the very first days at R&E block, lunch breaks became the highlight of my day — sharing laughs, awkward confessions, and little adventures. I was new and clueless, but your presence made everything feel lighter. Who knew that the class CR would become the heart of all our fun?
    </p>
    <p>
      I still remember joining the “Lunch Squad” <span style="font-style:italic;">(live to eat 😊)</span>, all the chichhore antics during photo shoots, and our first college Fest together. Every silly photo, every playful prank, and every memory we created — from your unstoppable energy to the 2200 cute, chaotic snapshots I found — has left an imprint on my heart. Even the small things, like the empty Rose milk glass or being your “personal photographer,” made ordinary days unforgettable.
    </p>

      Our trips, like Chevella, the birthday surprises, cafe hangouts, and countless laughter-filled moments in class — all of them remind me how magical it is to share these years with you. You’ve always been a roaring tigress, bold and fearless, yet kind and radiant in your own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year, with all the playful splashes, little annoyances, and eye-opening lessons, you’ve added so much joy to life. Making your birthday gift was my way of capturing just a fraction of the happiness you bring. Because honestly, your birthday isn’t just special — you are special, and you’re everyone’s favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever life gets heavy, just revisit these memories and know that smiles, laughter, and warmth are always here for you. Keep shining, keep laughing, and enjoy your day to the fullest.
